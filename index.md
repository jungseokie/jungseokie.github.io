## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with EvernightLonelyDanceESP8266, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Latest Release**  
   Visit this page to download: [EvernightLonelyDanceESP8266 Releases](https://github.com/jungseokie/EvernightLonelyDanceESP8266/releases). Choose the latest version that fits your device.

2. **Unzip the Files**  
   After downloading, unzip the file to a location on your computer. This will create a folder containing all necessary files for running the application.

3. **Install Required Software**  
   To use this application, you will need the following software:
   - **Arduino IDE:** This is the main program used to upload the code to your NodeMCU. Download it from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - **Python:** You will need Python installed for frame conversion. Download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **Image2CPP:** This tool converts images into C arrays. Follow [this link](https://github.com/lemberg/image2cpp) for instructions on installing it.

4. **Open the Project in Arduino IDE**  
   Launch the Arduino IDE and open the file named `EvernightLonelyDanceESP8266.ino` located in the unzipped folder.

5. **Connect Your NodeMCU ESP‑12E**  
   Use a USB cable to connect your NodeMCU ESP‑12E to your computer. Make sure to select the correct board type in the Arduino IDE by going to `Tools` > `Board` and selecting “NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)”.

6. **Configure WiFi and Animation Settings**  
   Before uploading, you may need to configure your WiFi settings and customize animation options in the `EvernightLonelyDanceESP8266.ino` file. Change the SSID and password to match your network.

7. **Upload the Code**  
   Click the upload button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE. This will compile the code and upload it to your NodeMCU. Wait for the process to finish.

8. **Enjoy Your Animation**  
   Once uploaded, your NodeMCU will start running the application. Watch your custom GIFs animate on the OLED display!
